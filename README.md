# DNSSEC-resolver
The aim of this project is to build a custom DNS resolver that supports the DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) protocol. The resolver performs the traditional DNS resolution on different domain types and also reports performance metrics such as the query resolution time. To have a secure resolution, the DNS resolver uses the DNSSEC protocol.
